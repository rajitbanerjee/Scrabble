###Instructions for Code Execution - Assignment 1:
In order to run our code, you should run the main method from the PlayerTest class. 

The PlayerTest class contains four methods which test the classes; 
* Player
* Pool
* Frame
* Tile

Each test method carefully tests each class for the functionalities required by the assignment, 
and upon completion will display the outcome to the Command Line.

Where a test fails, a message will be printed recognising this and describing in which part of the program the problem lies.
However, if all tests pass, there will be no error messages and the only output will be a final message acknowledging the test is completed.
